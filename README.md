Just a place to put some "experiments" as I'm learning Go ..

* concurrentaccess - updating a slice from one goroutine, while accessing it from another goroutine as an http handler.
* helloexpvar - minimal example of using expvar to make things visible via an http handler.
* typealias - exploring issues when defining a type and then accessing it.
